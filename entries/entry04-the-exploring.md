# Entry 4: The Exploring
This week, I went more in depth to the syntax of C++. In the previous entry, I had a few
questions that I was curious about. While learning the syntax, I wondered why programmers
preferred to use one line of code over the other. Therefore, I decided that I needed to do
some research before I can use C++ to it's full extent. I knew that I would feel a lot more
comfortable using the code when I know the reasons why a programmer would use a line of code.

## What I learned/Questions Answered
**Question:** Why use endl if \n is easier to write?
* `std::endl` flushes the output, meaning that it will immediately perform the line of code.
Typically, this is used when displaying output from a long-running process, logging activity
of multiple threads or logging activity of a program that may crash unexpectedly.

* Programmers normally use `\n` over `std::endl` in situations that are unnecessary because
it worsens the performance of the output. So, programmers use `\n` more often than `std::endl`

## Takeaways

Referring to my previous entry, I know that in order for me to fully understand a concept, 
I need to turn it into something that I, myself can understand. Therefore, through the
week, I have been researching ways for me to fully understand a line of code. Although,
to many, this may seem like a waste of time -and I agree, it was very time consuming- I
feel that it is very essential for me to fully understand before I can move on
