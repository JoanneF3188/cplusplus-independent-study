# Entry 5: Outputting User Info
While learning new functions, I went back to when I was learning the basics of coding. When
learning a new language, my class would always learn how to output strings and functions.
So, I decided to try to find out how I could output strings with the user's input. 

## What I learned/Questions Answered
* Getline is a function in which it prompts a line of string that is outputted before and
grabs whatever is inputted by the user in the command line.
