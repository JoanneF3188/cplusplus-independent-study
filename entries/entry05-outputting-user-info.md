# Entry 5: Outputting User Info
While learning new functions, I went back to when I was learning the basics of coding. When
learning a new language, my class would always learn how to output strings and functions.
So, I decided to try to find out how I could output strings with the user's input. 

## What I learned/Questions Answered
* Getline is a function in which it prompts a line of string that is outputted before and
grabs whatever is inputted by the user in the command line.

* The syntax of `getline()` is
``` C
string name;
cout << "What's your name? ";
getline (cin, name);
cout << "Hello " << name << ".\n";
```

## Brain Thoughts/Questions to Answer

* How to use new function to implement into something I can use through manipulation of the
user's info
* How can I make use of `getline()`?

## Takeaways

#### Learn the basics
This week, while learning how to get user's info, I realized that it is a lot easier for
me to decide what I want to do and then learn how to do it. Having an objective in mind on
what I am looking for allows me to be able to understand more of how to use the new
functions.
