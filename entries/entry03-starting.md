# Entry 3: Starting

This where the actual learning starts. I found some references from my friend at
Hunter College because they are also learning C++. I also found that it is a lot
more easier for me to learn when the structure is set up in a way that a topic 
is introduced and taught in the form of a lesson.

Starting something is the hardest part for me because you have to make sure that
you made it clear of what you want to do. But, as soon as you start it, you
would need to be able to stick to that one thing and proceed it with interest.
To me, it is very difficult to start something mainly because I simply have no
idea which way is the right way to start. But, in programming, there is not 
really a set rule that you need to follow in order to start a project.
Although, it is always recommended that you start by pseudo-coding out with what
is it exactly that you want to do.

## What I learned

* Stream insertion operator `<<`
* `endl` means end line
* `\n` is an easier way to write `endl`
* `#include` is for lines not seen by compiler
* `using namespace std;` makes code more efficient instead of having to type 
```C
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	int number;
	number = 5;
	std::cout << "The number is " << number << "." << std::endl;
	return 0;
}
```
Output = `The number is 5.`

VS
```C
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int number;
	number = 5;
	cout << "The number is " << number << "." << endl;
	return 0;
}
```
Output = `The number is 5.`

## Brain Thoughts/Questions to Answer

* `\n` is an easier way to write `endl`... but what's the difference??
* !!! Why use `endl` if `\n` is easier to write?
* Preprocessor directive?

## Takeaways

Although, I understand that not all of the resources online can be found
in this structure, I believe that the easiest way to learn a language is
to find a way for you to turn it into something that YOU can understand.
It is difficult a lot of the times to find the right resource because
everyone has their own style of learning and it is best when you can
understand it and put it into your own words and style your own resources.
