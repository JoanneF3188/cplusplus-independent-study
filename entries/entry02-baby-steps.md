# Entry 2: Baby Steps

This week, I learned that I needed to take baby steps in order for me to fully 
understand something. I spent a lot of time testing out how I could output "Hello World" in
the console, in many ways. 

## What I learned

Something that I learned from my research, so far, was that there are a lot of different 
libraries within C++ and is included by inputting it in the header.

For example:
``` C
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
	std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
	return 0;
}
```

These are called input or output libraries.

I also learned that `return 0` is equivalent to a success. When this happens, this ends the
program because it is telling the program that it has succeeded in fulfilling it's actions.

Also, `std::cout` means standard output stream, which is similar to `console.log` in
javascript.

## Brain Thoughts

* DON'T FORGET SEMICOLONS!!!
* Fully understand something before you move on to more complicated stuff!

## Takeaways

A takeaway that I had from this is that you should always keep track of your references
and college slides are also a great reference in learning a new language.
