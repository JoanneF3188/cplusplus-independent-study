# Entry 1: The Plan

I have always wanted to learn C++ because I knew that it would be a very useful
language for future uses. But, I knew that the language is indeed a very difficult
language to learn, based on the prior research that I did to deciding what I 
wanted to do for my independent study. With advice from my teacher and friends,
I have come to a conclusion that this language would be something very different
from what I have been learning. So, I decided that I want to take up this challenge
and learn C++.

## What is C++?

From what I have researched, C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming
language. It is basically an extension to the language C. C++ is also one of the
most popular languages mainly used with system/application software, drivers, 
client-server applications and embedded firmware. It's also very similar to 
previous codes that I have learned in the past like, Javascript and Ruby 
(with object orientation). The first thought that came to my head, while I 
was researching, was game programmers, leading to my debate on whether I want to
create a tutorial or an actual game.

## What to do/Ideas

This is the point in which I am still a little stuck in between. I started to 
learn a little bit of the syntax for C++, but it still seems a little too hard 
for me to be able to create something with it. Therefore, I plan to consult with
a few of my classmates, teacher and friends to decide what I would want to do
with this knowledge. Currently, I am leaning more towards the tutorial because
I just want to get the jist of it down, for now.

## Takeaways

The major takeaway that I had to is that I really like to challenge myself
a lot, to the point where I may be over-estimating myself, but I believe that
with encouragement from my friends, classmates, teachers and motivation to
learn the language, I believe that I am able to overcome this challenge and
learn C++.
