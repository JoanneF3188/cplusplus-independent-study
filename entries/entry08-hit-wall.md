# Entry 8: I've hit a wall!

<img src="../images/running-into-wall.gif"/>

It has seem that I have hit a wall with my project. I was unable to figure out
how to make the rock, papers, scissor game to work. Therefore, what I am
planning to do from now on is to create a tutorial within my last week of my
9 week project. I have learned a lot since I have started my project, but with
the limited resources and time that I have available, I was not able to create
something with C++. But, like the wall on platform 9 and 3/4, there's a
way through it.

## What I decided

I have decided that I will be creating a tutorial for my fellow classmates and
those that do need the basics of C++. For me, the tutorials that I have looked
for online are a bit difficult for me to understand. Therefore, I decided that
I can make a tutorial through my perspective as I continue to gradually grow
my knowledge of C++ in order to hopefully assist in understanding a little
easier.

Some tutorials that I have found are:

## Takeaways
#### There's always a way AROUND and don't give up!!
Don't get me wrong. I am not giving up on my project for rock, paper, scissors.
I am still going to work on this project on my free time and continue to expand
my knowledge on C++ in order for me to be able to finish my mini project. I am
contemplating on whether I should seek some ideas from my friends outside of
school to help me with understanding how to make my project work. I am hoping
that by this summer, I will be able to have more knowledge on C++ and finish
my mini project in order to come up with better projects that will make an impact
on people's lives.
